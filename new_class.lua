--- An instantiatable class to inherit for defining new instantiatble classes classes
-- the "base" class. To make a new class call `new_class:inherit(your_new_class)`.
-- Also note that these classes will not have the type `table` but instead `class` when `type(object)` is called.
-- This is apart of the [LEEF-class](https://github.com/Luanti-Extended-Engine-Features/LEEF-class) module

--- instance
-- @field instance defines wether the object is an instance, use this in construction to determine what changes to make

--- base_class
-- @field base_class only present for instances: the class from which this instance originates

--- parent_class
-- @field parent_class the class from which this class was inherited from

--- creates a new base class. Calls all constructors in the chain with def.instance=true
-- @param self the table which is being inherited (meaning variables that do not exist in the child, will read as the parent's). Be careful to remember that subtable values are NOT inherited, use the constructor to create subtables.
-- @param def the table containing the base definition of the class. This should contain a @{construct}
-- @return def a new base class
-- @function inherit(self)

--- creates an instance of the base class. Calls all constructors in the chain with def.instance=true
-- @param def field for the new instance of the class. If fields are not present they will refer to the base class's fields (if present in the base class).
