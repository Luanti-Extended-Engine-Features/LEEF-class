--- An instantiatable class to inherit for defining new instantiatble classes classes
-- the "base" class. To make a new class call `new_class:inherit(your_new_class)`

-- @classmod new_class

mtul.class.new_class = {
    instance = false,
    --__no_copy = true
}
--- new_class
-- @table new_class
-- @field instance defines wether the object is an instance, use this in construction to determine what changes to make
-- @field base_class only present for instances: the class from which this instance originates
-- @field parent_class the class from which this class was inherited from

--- creates a new base class. Calls all constructors in the chain with def.instance=true
-- @param def the table containing a new definition (where the class calling the method is the parent). The content of the definition will override the fields for it's children.
-- @return def a new base class
-- @function Guns4d.Instantiatable_class:inherit()

--- construct
-- every parent constructor is called in order of inheritance, this is used to make changes to the child table. In self you will find base_class defining what class it is from, and the bool instance indicating (shocking) wether it is an instance.
-- @function construct where self is the definition (after all higher parent calls) of the table. This is the working object, no returns necessary to change it's fields/methods.


--- creates an instance of the base class. Calls all constructors in the chain with def.instance=true
-- @return def a new instance of the class.
